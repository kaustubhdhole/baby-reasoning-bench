# Evaluation model set

This reasoning bench evaluation will use four models, split across CHILDES-style training and BabyLM entrants.

## CHILDES-trained models (2)

1. **childes-gpt2-small** — GPT-2 small trained from scratch on CHILDES transcripts.
2. **childes-gpt2-medium** — GPT-2 medium trained from scratch on the same CHILDES transcripts to provide a size comparison.

## BabyLM models (2)

1. **BabyLM-10M (gpt2-10m)** — official BabyLM 10M-parameter baseline for small-scale comparison.
2. **BabyLM-100M (gpt2-100m)** — official BabyLM 100M-parameter baseline to contrast with the smaller BabyLM model.
